java cITD102: Introduction to Computer Systems Workbook 2: High Level Technologies (24C2) 
This document contains the further investigation questions relevant to the first part of this unit. You must undertake the questions individually.
DUE DATE: Further investigation should be done individually.  The due date for the Further Investigation Workbook 2 is Friday @11:59 PM of Week 10 (complete electronic copy only via Canvas). The late submission period is valid for this assessment (further investigation questions only). Late submissions after this, without an official extension, cannot be marked. The submission link will open early and allow multiple attempts. Only the last valid submission will be assessed.
The use of generative AI tools, e.g. Chat GPT, is allowed for the purpose of responding specifically as outlined in each question explanation. Any generated content needs to be appropriately referenced and notes provided as to what prompts were used to generate the content. When referencing the content generated by the AI software for guidance go to QUT Cite|Write APA-Internet Sources-Generative AI. Generative AI is not,  however, to be used in the other tasks in the assessment. The use of such tools when not authorised may be treated as a breach of MOPP Academic Integrity S6 (13)  and appropriate penalties imposed.
Plagiarism checking: Please note once your work is submitted, it will be checked against an extensive database of student submissions (including past semesters/college submissions), publications and Internet content. Copied sections and AI generated content are not eligible to receive a grade, i.e. we will assess only your work.
Further investigation questions
Topic 5: Languages and Libraries
This weeks’ content describes the two key methods by which we manage complexity in computer systems: high level programming languages and software libraries. These techniques are used extensively at all levels of a computer system from low level hardware and software to business processes and workflows. These questions explore programming languages, and software libraries and their APIs.Use one of the following questions as a prompt for your text generation AI of choice. Your solution should be two to three pages – there is a lot of copying and pasting. Please provide well thought-out answers; use critical thinking and try to be insightful: do not trust the AI or repeat marketing hype from companies. Remember to correctly cite and reference all material you use (http://www.citewrite.qut.edu.au/cite/ ). Your answer must have a list of references and in text citations. Answers without correct referencing will not pass. Have the AI answer one of the following questions and provide your analysis in the table on the next page:1. Version Control
Explain how version control is used to manage complexity in large projects. Choose two
implementations of version control software and compare their features and benefits.2. Programming Languages
Investigate one of the following new programming languages: Julia, rust or Swift. Explain its design and implementation and how they relate to their intended use and benefits over more traditional languages.
